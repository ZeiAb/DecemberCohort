          <h2> Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>185g unsalted butter</li>
                <li>185g best dark chocolate</li>
                <li>85g plain flour</li>
                <li>40g cocoa powder</li>
                <li>50g white chocolate</li>
                <li>50g milk chocolate</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>75g golden caster sugar</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark<br> chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.</li><br>
                <li>Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top <br> so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until<br> the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.</li><br>
                <li>Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling <br>film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to<br> cool to room temperature.</li><br>
                <li>While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and <br>turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li><br>
                <li>Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line<br> the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl.<br> Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.</li><br>
                <li>Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.</li><br>
                <li>Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric<br> mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on<br> how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and <br>about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and <br>wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the sur-<br>face of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.</li><br>
                <li>Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber<br> spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and<br>in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round<br> after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is<br>a mottled dark brown. </li><br>
                <li>Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture,<br> shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.</li><br>
                <li>Gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry<br> and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up<br> looking gungy and fudgy. </li><br>
                <li>Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.</li><br>
                <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease<br> the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.</li><br>
                <li>Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out <br>a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in<br> and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to <br>come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.</li><br>
                <li>Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the<br> protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base.They’ll keep in an airtight container<br> for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.</li><br>
